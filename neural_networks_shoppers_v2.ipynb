    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the online shoppers purchasing intentions dataset will be used to train a neural network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we can define the algorithm of a neural network as a mathematical function with flexibility to solve any problem simply by varying the weights. The algorithm is modelled much like the brain and is designed to recognise patterns by containing artificial neurons with the ability to learn. The result of this creation became the well known perceptron which is a model architecture of a binary classifier. However, as the working dataset explored is much more complex, the multilayer perceptron will be used subsequently and includes with the following 3 layers:\n",
    "1. Input - consists of neurons making up the attributes\n",
    "2. Hidden - transforms the layer with a weighted summation including the activation function e.g. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)\n",
    "3. Output - receives the values from the last hidden layer and produces the label\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given one hidden layer and one neuron, the function \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  f(x) = W_{2}g(W^{T}_{1}x+b_{1}+b_{2})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "can be learned by initialising the model parameters \n",
    "$\n",
    "  W_{1}\\in\\R^{m}\n",
    "$\n",
    "and\n",
    "$\n",
    "  \\newcommand{\\R}{\\mathbb{R}}\n",
    "  W_{2},b_{1},b_{2}\\in\\R\n",
    "$\n",
    "With $W_{1}$ and $W_{2}$ as the weights of both the input and hidden layer and finally, $b_{1}$ and $b_{2}$ as the bias within the hidden and output layer. The inputs are then passed through an activation rule which exerts influence on a unit with its current state to produce the output (1). Lastly, the model is tested to see how good it is at predicting based on a given set of parameters by using cross entropy. Model optimisation will also be explored in the sections below."

    "## Preprocessing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was first examined by importing the csv file which was then later transferred to a pandas dataframe for easy retrieval. As mentioned before in the previous learning tasks, the data is highly categorical and will need to be encoded before it can be used to fit and train the model. The data was then split into features and labels in preparation for the train test split."

    "Using Pytorch's library to build the model allowed for the use of the base class of the neural network modules which made development simple. Due to the backward step being fully handled by Pytorch, we can focus on creating the forward step. Firstly the hidden layers needed to be created, in this instance 3 layers were created which will apply the linear transformation to the incoming data. The choice of 3 was purely arbitrary due to the fact that both layers and nodes are model hyperparameters but research from similar datasets suggests that it may be best to go for greater depth as this results in better generalisation for a wider variety of tasks. Furthermore, deep architectures tend to convey useful priors which leads over the function space for the model to learn (2). \n",

There are many activation functions availabe such as the commonly used Sigmoid or Tanh but for this model, ReLU was the chosen function and can be defined as: $max(0,z)$. Comparing to the Sigmoid, ReLU is also non-linear given that it takes real values as inputs and provides outputs as 0s and 1s but the only difference is that it generally gives better performance by avoiding vanishing gradient problems (3).

When it comes to parameters that would be given small updates, ADAM gives large updates due to storing both the exponentially decaying average of past squared gradients and the exponentially decarying average of past gradients. In comparison, SGD's learning rate tends to have the same effect for all weights in the model which could slow down and will require manual tuning whereas ADAM converges much faster (6).\n",

An epoch is essentially the number of times the algorithm will see the entire training set not to be confused with iteration which is the number of batches the algorithm has seen. As ADAM is used which is an iterative process, it is not advised to use one epoch. This is due to the fact that one epoch is insufficient in updating weights on a single pass and therefore lead to underfitting (6). In light of this, epoch was set to 100 as it is purely heuristics and gives the model a chance to readjust the parameters so it is not biased towards the last few data points. "
